Big-O Sorting Algorithms

Welcome to the Big-O Sorting Algorithms repository! This project provides implementations of various sorting algorithms in C#, designed for educational purposes. The repository includes the following algorithms:

    Bubble Sort
    Bucket Sort
    Counting Sort
    Heap Sort
    Insertion Sort
    Merge Sort
    Quick Sort
    Radix Sort
    Selection Sort
    Shell Sort

Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to help users understand and compare the time complexities and efficiencies of different sorting algorithms.
