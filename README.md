## Big-O Sorting Algorithms

Welcome to the Big-O Sorting Algorithms repository! This project provides implementations of various sorting algorithms in C#, designed for educational purposes. The repository includes the following algorithms:

   - Bubble Sort
   - Bucket Sort
   - Counting Sort
   - Heap Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Quick Sort
   - Radix Sort
   - Selection Sort
   - Shell Sort

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to help users understand and compare the time complexities and efficiencies of different sorting algorithms.
